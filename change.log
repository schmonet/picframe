- Fixed a bug in `pir_manager.py` where the inactivity timer was unreliable due to using `time.time()` instead of `time.monotonic()`. This ensures the display turns off correctly after a period of inactivity, even if the system time changes (e.g., due to NTP syncs).
- Removed email address from README.md.
- Added file headers with author and AI contribution information to all scripts in `picframe_scripts`.
- Updated `changes.txt` to include `README.md` and reflect the latest changes.

- Fixed Ken Burns effect continuing to run during pause mode in `viewer_display.py`.
- Major refactoring of `pir_manager.py` to remove MQTT dependency.
- Slideshow pausing (`HOLD` state) is now controlled via direct HTTP calls to the picframe web server.
- The `BLACK` state now directly turns off the display using `cec-client`.

11-09-2025
- Fixed a `TypeError` in `interface_mqtt.py` by replacing `|` with `Union` for type hints to support older Python versions.

10-09-2025
- Replaced the WLAN check in `sync_photos.sh` with a more reliable ping to `8.8.8.8`.
- Removed the redundant WLAN check and now only check for the server's reachability.
- Replaced `kmsblank` with `cec-client` in `pir_manager.py` for display power control.
- Added `cec-utils` to `install.sh`.
- Extended `test_pir.py` to a full state-sequence test script.
