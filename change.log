- Enhanced `scripts/check_pic_dates.sh` to support video files (`mkv`, `mp4`, etc.).
- The script now reads creation date metadata from video containers using `exiftool`, in addition to image EXIF data.
- Refactored `scripts/sync_photos.sh` to support separate storage quotas for photos and videos within a single cache.
- Introduced a unified cache directory in `scripts/sync_config.yaml` to ensure compatibility with `picframe`.
- The sync script now calculates storage usage per media type to enforce quotas.
- Removed all automatic cache cleanup logic from the sync script to allow the cache to be filled continuously.

2025-09-30:
- Corrected aspect ratio calculation in `viewer_display.py` to prevent horizontal stretching of portrait images.
- Replaced incorrect aspect ratio logic in `viewer_display.py`.

2025-10-01:
- Corrected the calculation of start and end points for vertical panning in `viewer_display.py`.
- Corrected the conversion of pixel offset to shader uniform offset in `viewer_display.py`.

2025-10-02:
- Refactored `__calculate_kenburns_transform` in `viewer_display.py` to add a slight zoom for portrait images and randomize zoom and pan for landscape images.

2025-10-03:
- Modified `viewer_display.py` to calculate pan/wobble range based on display dimensions.
- Corrected the pannable area calculation in `viewer_display.py` to prevent black borders.
- Split `kenburns_wobble_pct` into `kenburns_landscape_wobble_pct` and `kenburns_portrait_wobble_pct`.
- Corrected a `SyntaxError` in `viewer_display.py`.

2025-10-04:
- Corrected `AttributeError` in `viewer_display.py` by initializing and using new wobble parameters.
- Fixed inconsistent Ken Burns effect for landscape images by enforcing a minimum zoom in `viewer_display.py`.
- Corrected script path in `install.sh` to reflect new directory structure.
- Provided guidance on fixing `FileNotFoundError` for config file by updating `watcher.sh`.
- Provided guidance on fixing shell script errors by converting line endings with `dos2unix`.

2025-10-05:
- Created a new shell script `check_pic_dates.sh` to check and correct image dates based on directory names and EXIF data.
- Added `libimage-exiftool-perl` to `install.sh` to provide `exiftool`.
- Corrected the clock's vertical position calculation in `viewer_display.py`.
- Fixed a bug in `check_pic_dates.sh` that caused an invalid date format for the `touch` command.
- Added an 'A' (All) option to `check_pic_dates.sh` to process all directories without further prompts.
- Fixed a syntax error (`;&&`) in `check_pic_dates.sh`.
- Fixed a corrupted `while` loop in `check_pic_dates.sh` that caused a syntax error.

2025-10-14
- Modified `scripts/pir_manager.py` to start `picframe` immediately if motion is detected during the night-off period.
- This overrides the night schedule for the current cycle, preventing the system from turning off again until the next night.
- Added a `night_override` flag to manage this state.
- Fixed a bug where the '~' in `CONFIG_PATH` was not expanded, by using `os.path.expanduser()`.

2025-10-18
- Added `scripts/create_test_images.sh` to generate test images by converting PNGs to JPGs.
- The script overlays image metadata (dimensions, color space) onto the image and adds randomized EXIF data.
- Iteratively debugged the script to handle shell syntax errors and system locale differences for number formatting.
- Enhanced the script to differentiate between portrait and landscape images, adjusting text size and position accordingly.
- Modified the text overlay to use a bold font for better readability.
- Finalized `scripts/create_test_images.sh` by adjusting text position and style for portrait images, including larger text and a refined outline for better visibility.
